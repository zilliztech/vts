## Overview

**VTS** (Vector Transport Service) is an open-source tool for moving [vectors](https://zilliz.com/glossary/vector-embeddings) and [unstructured data](https://zilliz.com/learn/introduction-to-unstructured-data). It is developed by [Zilliz](https://zilliz.com/) based on **Apache Seatunnel**.

## Why do you need a vector and unstructured data moving tool?
1. **Meeting the Growing Data Migration Needs:** VTS evolves from our Milvus Migration Service, which has successfully helped over 100 organizations migrate data between [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus) clusters. User demands have grown to include migrations from different [vector databases](https://zilliz.com/learn/what-is-vector-database), traditional search engines like [Elasticsearch](https://zilliz.com/comparison/milvus-vs-elastic) and Solr, [relational databases](https://zilliz.com/blog/relational-databases-vs-vector-databases), data warehouses, document databases, and even S3 and data lakes to Milvus.
2. **Supporting Real-time Data Streaming and Offline Import:** As vector database capabilities expand, users require both real-time data streaming and offline batch import options.
3. **Simplifying Unstructured Data Transformation:** Unlike traditional ETL, transforming unstructured data requires AI and model capabilities. VTS, in conjunction with the [Zilliz Cloud Pipelines](https://zilliz.com/zilliz-cloud-pipelines), enables vector embedding, tagging, and complex transformations, significantly reducing data cleaning costs and operational complexity.
4. **Ensuring End-to-End Data Quality:** Data integration and synchronization processes are prone to data loss and inconsistencies. VTS addresses these critical data quality concerns with robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms.

## Core Capabilities of VTS
Built on top of Apache Seatunnel, Vector-Transport-Service offers:
1. Rich, extensible connectors
2. Unified stream and batch processing for real-time synchronization and offline batch imports
3. Distributed snapshot support for data consistency
4. High performance, low latency, and scalability
5. Real-time monitoring and visual management

Additionally, Vector-Transport-Service introduces vector-specific capabilities such as multiple data source support, schema matching, and basic data validation. 

## Roadmap

Future developments include:
- Incremental synchronization
- Combined one-time migration and change data capture
- Advanced data transformation capabilities
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed
- Access to source and target databases
- Required credentials and permissions
- Milvus Version >= 2.3.6

### Quick Start

1. **Pull the VTS Image**
Fetch the prebuilt VTS container (built on Apache SeaTunnel) and open an interactive shell inside the image so you can run jobs without building from source.
```bash
docker pull zilliz/vector-transport-service:latest
docker run -it zilliz/vector-transport-service:latest /bin/bash
```

2. **Configure Your Migration** Create a job configuration (e.g., `migration.conf`) that declares the execution env, a source connector, and a sink connector. Start with small batches and a single collection/table to validate connectivity before scaling up.
```yaml
env {
  parallelism = 1
  job.mode = "BATCH"
}

source {
  # Source configuration (e.g., Milvus, Elasticsearch, etc.)
  Milvus {
    url = "https://your-source-url:19530"
    token = "your-token"
    database = "default"
    collections = ["your-collection"]
    batch_size = 100
  }
}

sink {
  # Target configuration
  Milvus {
    url = "https://your-target-url:19530"
    token = "your-token"
    database = "default"
    batch_size = 10
  }
}
```

3. **Run the Migration**
Run in cluster mode for productionâ€‘like workloads, or local mode for quick validation. Watch the console output to confirm progress.

Cluster Mode (Recommended):
```bash
# Start the cluster
mkdir -p ./logs
./bin/seatunnel-cluster.sh -d

# Submit the job
./bin/seatunnel.sh --config ./migration.conf
```

Local Mode:
```bash
./bin/seatunnel.sh --config ./migration.conf -m local
```

### Configuration Tips
- Adjust `parallelism` based on your data volume
- Configure appropriate `batch_size` for optimal performance
- Set up proper authentication and security measures
- Monitor system resources during migration
